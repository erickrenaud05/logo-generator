# logo-generator

## Description
This is a command prompt application that uses the inquirer package to prompt the user for information on the logo they want to create. This application creates an svg file called logo.svg. It supports making a square logo, a circle and a triangle. Your logo can have up to 3 letters. Your text and shape can be any color you like.

## Usage
Once installed, make sure your terminal is in the project directory. From here run node index.js and fill out the prompts. The text prompt will only accept up to three letters, you will be re-prompted if you attempt to add more. The color prompts accept any color from the color library in either hexadecimal or by name. To use the hexadecimal colors, just write the hexadecimal value without '#'. Then once the logo is generated, you can bring the logo.svg file wherever you want and add it to any project you would like. Here is a video demonstration on how to use this generator: [Demonstration](/Module10ScreenRecording.mp4).
